## Background
Dog breed classification is a challenging problem due to the large variety of dog breeds and the subtle differences in their appearance. This project aims to address this challenge using deep learning algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs). By training a CNN on a large dataset of dog images labeled with their respective breeds, we can create a model capable of accurately predicting the breed of a dog from an input image.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AwnishRanjan/Dog-Breed-Classification.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Dog-Breed-Classification
    ```

3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation:** If you have your own dataset, place it in the `data/` directory. Otherwise, the project comes with sample datasets for testing.

2. **Model Training:** Train the model using the provided scripts or notebooks in the `notebook/` directory.

3. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model's performance using evaluation metrics and visualizations.

4. **Inference:** Use the trained model for inference by providing input images and obtaining predictions.
